# CRT-Internship
As an intern with CodingRaja Technologies, I was selected for Web Development. I got two tasks to complete in this internship with guidance with the internship mentors. I came up with the both tasks for which I created a website as a Personal Portfolio and Music Player Clone.

I undertook this internship project and completed it under the guidance of CodingRaja Technologies Management. I am grateful to their staff for their patience and assistance during my training. It was a good learning experience for me to work with them. These skills would help me expand my resume and advance my career.
